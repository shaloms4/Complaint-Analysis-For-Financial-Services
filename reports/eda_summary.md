Report for task-1 
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the CFPB complaint dataset revealed critical insights into its structure and content, guiding the preprocessing steps for CrediTrust Financial’s RAG-based complaint analysis tool. The dataset encompasses a wide range of financial products, with **Credit Card** and **Consumer Loan** (mapped to Personal Loan) dominating the complaint volume, while **Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)** and **Money Transfers** are less prevalent, reflecting their emerging or niche status. The distribution of complaints, visualized in a bar plot, underscores the need to filter out irrelevant products like mortgages and student loans to focus on CrediTrust’s five target categories: Credit Card, Personal Loan, BNPL, Savings Account, and Money Transfers. Narrative length analysis showed that most `Consumer complaint narrative` entries range from 50 to 500 words, with outliers as short as 10 words or exceeding 1,000 words, indicating that the RAG pipeline must accommodate diverse text lengths for effective semantic search.

Approximately 30-40% of complaints lack narratives, as depicted in a bar plot of narrative presence, necessitating their exclusion to ensure high-quality input for the RAG system. Among complaints with narratives, the five target products were well-represented after mapping and disambiguating ambiguous categories like `Credit card or prepaid card` and `Installment loan` using keyword-based classification. The preprocessing steps reduced the dataset to about 60% of its original size, focusing on non-empty narratives and relevant products/sub-products. The cleaned dataset, saved to `data/filtered_complaints.csv`, is optimized for vectorization, enabling product managers like Asha to quickly identify customer pain points across CrediTrust’s offerings, supporting the goal of reducing trend identification time from days to minutes.
